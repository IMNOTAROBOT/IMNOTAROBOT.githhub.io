          <h2>Decision taking and motion planing with LTL</h2>
          (Masters in Computer Science Thesis)
          <p>I propose a system that produces motion planning routes for high level tasks by using linear temporal logic (LTL). Every task described as an LTL formula can be translated to a finite deterministic automata. </p>
          <p>The system includes a user console where the known task to be executed can be specified. Also, more goals can be added on running time. The plans are generated using a two level planner. In the first level the regions of interest related to configurations of the robot and the LTL formula are used. In the second level a Rapidly - Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner is used to create valid paths between the regions of interest included in the first level plan.</p> 
          <p>At the end, the trajectory and the planning tree are shown using ROS 3D Visualizer (Rviz) and it is simulated on Gazebo. Several experiments were conducted to test the basic skills of the system, which includes solving sequential, coverage and disjunction automata for the base of a simulated Personal Robot 2 (PR2) of 3 degrees of freedom.</p>

          <h2>ITAMSAT-1</h2>
          (Telecommunications BS degree thesis)
          <p>I propose the design, construction, validation and evaluation of ITAMSAT-1, a can sized satellite (CANSAT) for didactic activities. ITAMSAT-1 is capable of obtaining meteorological data (ozone (O3), humidity and temperature) and transmit it to the earth station through radio communication. </p>
          <p>This work is divided in the design of the satellite, followed by the construction. Then the validation and integration tests take place. The design of the prototype includes the different essential subsystems of a conventional satellite: (i) power, (ii) control, (iii) mission, (iv) communication, (v) geo localization, and (vi) mounting. </p>
          <p>Validation and integration tests ensure the correct operation of each component of ITAMSAT-1 individually and as an integrated system. The main evaluation experiment includes elevating ITAMSAT-1 between 1 to 100m high in the atmosphere with the mission of collecting meteorological data and transmit them to the earth station.</p> 
          <p>Two experiments were made, the first includes elevating the satellite using 6 giant balloons filled with helium and the second one implies elevating the satellite using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). All the data collected by ITAMSAT-1 are stored in order to be validated and later used. The earth station counts with a user interface that allows the users to visualize the data sent by ITAMSAT-1 in real time, also a journal of this information is stored.</p>

          <h2>Comparison of Low pass filter and double component Hill-type muscle models</h2>
          (USC Summer Research)
          <p>A muscle model is a system that simulates the tension generated by a muscle when it is
activated by neuron spikes. These kind of simulations are important for medical and rehab fields, allowing
many muscular disorders to be studied. </p>
          <p>Two different muscle models were implemented, validated and compared as part of my summer research at the Brain-Body Dynamics Lab at USC. The comparison between a simple low pass filter and a more complicated Hill-Type muscle model with two components shows that the tension created by a muscle can be simulated in different ways, according to the needs of each individual experiment. The experiments were rate coding and no recruitment was done; the models were fed with different frequency rates from 1 Hz to 80 Hz, and the results were compared for fixed and variable frequency exaltation. </p>
          <p>The implementation of the low pass filter was simpler compared to the Hill-Type model used. Factors such as fused and unfused tetanus vary depending on the model. It is proved that complex models are more likely to represent the real behaviour of a muscle depending on the components modelled for it. Modelling the active and passive force that is missing in the low pass filter gives the Hill-Type muscle model advantages over the first one in terms of accuracy to reality. The saturation of the motors was the biggest cause of limitation for the tension generated by the NI system.</p>
